Topic #6 Aside --- Tests
************************

* At the end of Topic 6 we played with our implementation by interacting with it
* This also allowed us to test the basic functionality

Unit Testing
============

* Ideally, when we test our code, we should test each *unit* or *component*
    * *Unit Testing*
    * We want good *coverage*

* When doing so, we will write individual functions to test the units/components
* These tests can also be run automatically

* By writing out tests like this, we end up being deliberate in our testing
    * We take the time to think of the things needing testing
    * It can also help us keep our units/components isolated

* It also obviously helps with testing and debugging
* If we ever make changes to the unit/component being tested, if our changes break it, the automated testing will find it

* Writing tests can be a bit of an art, so it's best to get a lot of practice


JUnit
=====

* JUnit
* Automate tests





* Checkout the :download:`ArrayStackTest.java<../test/java/ArrayStackTest.java>` for testing the ``ArrayStack``.
