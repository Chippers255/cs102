Linked Structure
================

* A linked data structure is one that consists of objects referencing other objects

    .. image:: img/links_example0.png
       :width: 500 px
       :align: center


* With this linking idea, we do not need to store the data in consecutive memory locations
    * Successors can be anywhere

* We can insert and delete things without having to shift data
* Linked structures do not have a fixed size
